Traditional methods of attendance tracking, such as manual sign-in sheets or swipe cards, are prone to errors, time-consuming, and lack reliability (Teachmint, 2023.). . Real-time biometrics attendance systems offer a cutting- edge solution by leveraging unique physiological or behavioral traits of individuals for instant and precise attendance verification.",
            "Real-time biometrics attendance systems utilize biometric identifiers such as fingerprints and facial features to authenticate individuals in real-time. This advanced technology captures and analyzes the biometric data of individuals as they check in or out, providing immediate and accurate attendance records. The speed and accuracy of real-time biometrics enable organizations to streamline their attendance management processes and make informed decisions based on reliable data.",
            "One of the key advantages of a real-time biometrics attendance system is its ability to eliminate time theft and buddy punching. Biometric traits are highly unique to individuals, making it virtually impossible for employees to cheat the system by proxy attendance. This level of security ensures that attendance records are accurate, and organizations can effectively manage workforce attendance, scheduling, and payroll.",

The Schiphol Privium scheme at the Amsterdam airport, for example, employs iris-scan cards to speed up the passport and visa control procedures (Jain et al., 2011). Passengers enrolled in this scheme insert their card at the gate and look into a camera; the camera acquires the image of the traveler’s eye and processes it to locate the iris and compute the Iris Code; the computed Iris Code is compared with the data residing in the card to complete user verification (Jain et al., 2011). A similar scheme is also being used to verify the identity of Schiphol airport employees working in high-security areas. Thus, biometric systems can be used to enhance user convenience while improving security ",
            "Biometric “is the science of analyzing physical or behavioral characteristics specific to each individual to authenticate their identity.” In a few words, it measures the human body. This technology can measure physiological and behavioral traits . A combination of characteristics can also be made as a multimodal biometric, which improves measurement confidence. Such combinations could be face and fingerprint, face and iris, etc. The main benefit of biometric technology is that it collects unique human characteristics for each person (Thales. 2020)",
            "Like virtually all sectors of the economy, education underwent drastic changes following the outbreak of COVID-19. In-person teaching virtually disappeared, with online learning taking its place across the world. As schools, universities and colleges continue to put the health and welfare of students at the forefront, a blended learning approach is expected to remain. Biometrics, could enable the education sector to meet the increasingly complex needs of students amidst this ongoing transformation.(Int J Interact Des Manuf. 2021)",
            "Biometric person recognition systems share many issues and challenges with other pattern recognition applications like video surveillance, speech technologies, human–computer interaction, data analytics applications, behavioral modeling, or recommender systems. Identity Management Systems (IMS) are platforms where a permission device gives access to a specific service. These are used in education to provide access to a given product or service or for electronic registration. Passwords are very unsafe and sometimes created to be easy to remember. Biometrics are used in this area for security reasons, as it can grant access to a given system to only authorized persons, identified by their physical or behavioral characteristics (Šošević, U., Milenković, I., Milovanović, M., & Minović, M. 2013). Fingerprint cards are already used in schools for students that acquire free meals in coffee shops (Gold, S. 2010). Indeed, the use of fingerprints is a common practice from elementary school to universities/research centers.",

Additionally, this proposal predicts if he/she would pass a final exam based on past data of the user’s behavior (using biometrics data).",
            "In the mode of verification, the system approves an individual’s identity by comparing the captured biometric features with the individual’s biometric template stored in the framework database. In this system, a person who aims to be positively identified claims a factor – generally by means of an individual distinguishing proof number (PIN) or a user name – then the framework system conducts a one-to-one comparison to decide whether the claim is true or not. This mode aims to answer the question “is this person whom he/she claims to be”.",
            "In the mode of identification, the individual’s identity is recognized by looking through template of all the users in the database for a match. Hence a system conducts a one -to- many comparisons to establish an individual’s identity. The identification mode classifies and identifies some unknown identity. It aims to answer questions such as “who is this person”. Distinguishing proof is a basic part in negative acknowledgment applications where the framework builds up whether the individual is who she denies being.  The motivation behind negative acknowledgment is to keep an individual from utilizing numerous identities. Identification may also be utilized as a part of positive acknowledgment for convenience (where the induvial is not required to prove an identity). While the traditional methods of personal recognition such as passwords and tokens work for positive recognition, only biometrics can be used for negative recognition (SALIL, P., SHARATH, P, and ANIL, K.  2003)."

The system is structured into two components: the API and the client. It utilizes MySQL for efficient data management and relies on the VS Code text editor for streamlined development and maintenance.",
            "On the server-side of the development, the researchers initially implement scaffolding for authentication. Fortify is chosen due to its agnostic implementation, providing high customization capabilities during the system development process. Additionally, Sanctum is incorporated to meet specific usage requirements, ensuring a comprehensive and secure authentication framework for the overall system. We also use MVC architecture as it offers a structured and modular approach to development. MVC provides a clear separation of concerns, allowing for the independent development and maintenance of different components.",
